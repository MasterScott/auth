# About 
 
```This is a End-2-End Encrypted Auth System I made to prove a point.
This should work on any C# Program as long as you have a hosting to host the php code.
I did not implement any database in the php, you're gunna have to do that yourself
If you have any ideas on ways to make this code more effieciant or anything just open a pull request!
```
